#parametersForModel rules:
#1. all comments must start with #
#2. all parameters must be on their own line without any #
#3. all parameters must be on the form x=5, with an equality sign
#4. parameter names are sensitive, do not change them
#5. booleans are represented as true or false, for example bol=true
#6. Parameters must be in the same order in this document as they are in the
    #code for each tuple. The parametersForModel.txt is only iterated once per
    #tuple.

# Simulation Parameters #
##########################

# Number of fishes

# Number of dimensions 2 or 3
dimension=3
# Time step the resolution of time
dt = 0.3
# Number of time steps
N_steps=2000
# Number of simulation runs, can be used to average measurements for the
# current code there is no reason to set it higher than 1
N_runs=1
# Number of times code is ran, this can be used to change variables for
# Each instance to generate statistic.Each instance one feature vector is made
# So there will be N_instances feature vectors appended to dataforAnalysis.CSV

###############################
# Data Analysis Parameters #
###############################

# Number of measurements the measurements are saved per Instance so if you want
# Many feature vectors then increase the number  of instances by increasing
# N_instances
N_measurements=50




# If this is set to true then for each instance a measure will be appended
# to CSV dataforAanalysis where the first entry is class
appendToDataForAnalysis=true


# Set your target value or class here, it will be assigned to all
# saved data for analysis if you generate different sets of data for
# classification it is very important that you change the target value
class=0

# Start measure at some percentage of N_steps
measure_Start=0

# Stop measuring at some percentage of N_steps

# Different measurements only use one at a time

# Uses a measure that gives the average position of each time step, then
# takes the sum of those positions and all their dimensions over all time
# and returns that value
avgPositionDimensionSum=true

# Uses measure that takes the average position
